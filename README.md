## Project introduction
The Chromie project is an IDEA plugin that helps fragmented developers organize their work time, improve coding focus, and reduce development anxiety.

## Project characteristics
### Fully localized
We care about data security and believe in the autonomy of developers. So the project uses fully localized data processing, and you don't have to worry about your data security.
### Complete open source
We open source the whole project and allow any developer to carry out secondary development on this basis. We also welcome you who are interested in the project to work with us to build and maintain this project.
